The app provides intuitive UX for curating content, setting delivery conditions, and managing access permissions. It explores interesting design questions around data persistence, privacy, and the emotional weight of software—how do you build something meant to outlast its creator?

LifeCapsule is an app that helps people record their daily positivity and find trends by asking questions like: Was it a good or bad day? What is something you can appreciate today? Who have you helped today? What was the weather?

The app records how good the user’s day was with random daily questions and automatically creates a weekly summary that displays interesting trends and statistics about the user’s week.
